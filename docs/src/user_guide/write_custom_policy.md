You can write a policy of your own that suits your needs.
To do so we recommend you write your own policy.
A template is available at [`tauri-fuzz-policies/src/policies/policy_template.rs`](https://github.com/crabnebula-dev/tauri-fuzz/blob/main/crates/tauri-fuzz-policies/src/policies/policy_template.rs).

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../crates/tauri-fuzz-policies/src/policies/policy_template.rs}}
```
